# HH Band

The Human Health (HH) Band is an embedded device created by Strawberry Crest High School which competed and won in [Samsung's 2023 Solve for Tomorrow Challenge](https://www.samsung.com/us/solvefortomorrow/).

The HH Band seeks to reduce the chance of a student athlete suffering from a heat-related illness by allowing coaches to monitor body temperatures. You can watch the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHPi2ZQ0xP4) and [pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olc2RPnq6Hk&t=6544s) to learn more.
